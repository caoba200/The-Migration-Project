# The Migration Project
This is  my personal work to move all of my code from Computer Science classes at U or R to GitHub. A perfect chance to review my works (especially C++) and the progression I have made in my university career. 
## CS 110 - Programming and Problem Solving
An introduction to problem-solving techniques, the fundamental concepts of programming, and the software design process. Topics will include: data types, control structures, scope rules, functions, files, and the mechanics of running, testing and debugging.
## CS 115 - Object-Oriented Design
This course focuses on the concepts of object-oriented programming. Topics include data abstraction, classes, composition and inheritance, subtyping, dynamic binding, polymorphism and dynamic memory management. Other topics include type systems, two-dimensional arrays, records, references, searching and sorting algorithms, language translation. Software engineering: comprehensibility, correctness, efficiency, refactoring.
## CS 210 - Data Structures and Abstractions
This course introduces data abstraction, data structures and their implementations, the basics of algorithmic analysis, and the fundamental computing algorithms. Topics include stacks, queues, heaps, recursion, Master Theorem, asymptotic notation, computational complexity, empirical performance measurement, recursion based sorting algorithms, hashing, and trees (including binary trees, B-trees, and AVL trees).
## CS 215 - Web and Database Programming
This course shows how interactive database-driven web applications are designed and implemented. Appropriate protocols and languages for web and database programming will be discussed, with a focus on client-server architectures, interface design, graphics and visualization, event-driven programming, information management, data modeling, and database systems.
